                          <p>A ‘<strong>domain name</strong>’, in simple terms, is a unique identifier with a set of
                            properties attached to it so that computers can perform conversions. An example of a domain
                            name is "<a class="sc-bHwgHz jKubed" href="http://icann.org"
                              title="http://icann.org">icann.org</a>". Most commonly, the property attached to the
                            domain name is an IP address, like "208.77.188.103", so that computers can convert the

                          <p>When the User avails any of the Services, User will be subject to the rules, guidelines,
                            policies, terms, and conditions applicable to such service, and they shall be deemed to be
                            incorporated into this Terms of Service and shall be considered as a part of this Terms of
                            Service. The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or
                            remove portions of this Terms of Service, at any time without any prior written notice to
                            the User. It is the User’s sole responsibility to review this Terms of Service periodically
                            for updates or changes. The User’s continued use of the Portal following the posting of
                            changes shall be deemed to mean that the User accepts and agrees to the revisions. As long
                            as the User complies with this Terms of Service, the Company grants the User a personal,
                            non-exclusive, limited privilege to enter and use the Portal.</p>

                          <p>In addition, the Company may occasionally notify User of changes or modifications to this
                            Terms of Service by email. It is therefore very important that the User keep User’s Account
                            Information, including User’s email address, updated. The Company assumes no liability or
                            responsibility for User’s failure to receive an email notification if such failure results
                            from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address.</p>

                      <p>The Company may provide a translation of the English version of this Terms of Service into
                        other languages. User understands and agrees that any translation of this Terms of Service into
                        other languages is only for User’s convenience and that the English version shall govern the
                        terms of User’s relationship with the Company. In the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity
                        arising between the English version of this Terms of Service and its other translated versions,
                        the English version of this Terms of Service shall prevail over others such translated versions.
